# L3BNet_DeepLearning_Vision
Design a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model named L3BNet, train and validate on the Tiny ImageNet ( 100,000 images, 200 classes), achieve top1 accuracy at 0.47, top5 accuracy at 0.72 (50 epochs) and also come out with a report including more details and comparison with 2 state of art models.
